This currently only works in Windows due to the use of the VideoCapture module.

Dependencies: 
	VideoCapture Module (http://videocapture.sourceforge.net/)
	Python Image Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
	optional: PSFTP, Pageant, PuTTYgen, and PuTTY for automatic uploading to a server. psftp.exe should be saved in the same folder as the script. (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

This program takes a sequence of photos when motion is detected. It can save the photos to a local drive and can upload them to a remote computer. For increased stealth, rename the file extension to .pyw so that it does not open up a console window. To kill the program after running as .pyw, kill pythonw.exe in the process list, or use this script (save with .cmd extension):
	:START
	TASKKILL /F /IM "pythonw.exe"
	
For the script to be able to upload the photos to a remote computer, a saved PuTTY session must be present with the private SSH key loaded in Pageant. The public key must also be in the remote computer's authorized_keys file.
Create an SSH key in PuTTYgen. Add the public key to the remote computer's authorized_keys file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys), and save the private key on your computer. In PuTTY, create and save a session that uses the private key to connect to the remote server ("cam" is the same of the session in the script). Start Pageant, then load the key.

If you don't want to upload the files to a remote computer, you can just ignore these steps and the program should be able to run as-is. But to be cleaner and safer, remove the code pertaining to uploading.

If there are multiple cameras connected, change number in "showVideoWindow=0".
